üëã Hi, I'm R√¥mulo Takaoka.

I'm a `ferocious learner` with 9 years of professional experience. I believe I have the **maturity and resilience** to face any challenge in life.

- Back-end with `Node.js`
- Database with `SQL`
- Familiarity with `REST API` or `GraphQL`
- Code versioning with `Git` and `GitHub`

### ü§ù Soft Skills:
