üëã Hi, I'm R√¥mulo Takaoka.

I'm a `ferocious learner` with 9 years of professional experience.
I believe I have the **maturity and resilience** to face any challenge in life.
Everything I do either at work or in life, I do with purpose, to fulfill my faith and bring the best to my family.

## Those are my main skills:
### ‚öí Hard Skills:
- Front-end with `React.js`
- Favorite framework: `Next.js`
- Programming Languages: `Typescript`, `JavaScript` and some `Python`
- Favorite framework for styles: `Tailwind CSS`, but recently I had the opportunity to work with `Stitches` and loved it.
- Back-end with `Node.js`
- Database with `SQL`
- Familiarity with `REST API` or `GraphQL`
- Code versioning with `Git` and `GitHub`

### ü§ù Soft Skills:
- Agile Projects Management
- IT Governance
- Business Analysis
- Public Speaking
- Problem Solving
